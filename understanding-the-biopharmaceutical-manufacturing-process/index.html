Commercial Production & Supply Chain Management</p><ol><li>Cell Line Development
Cell line development is the foundational step in the biopharmaceutical manufacturing process. The choice of cell line is critical, as it impacts yield, productivity, and the characteristics of the final product. Typically, mammalian cells such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells or other cells like yeast and bacterial cultures are utilized.
The steps involved in cell line development include:</li></ol><p>Selection of the Parent Cell: The ideal parent cell is selected based on the desired characteristics of the final product, including growth rates, productivity, and post-translational modifications.
Transfection: The cell line is genetically modified to express the desired protein. This often involves the introduction of plasmids containing the genetic information for the target protein.
Selection of Clones: Following transfection, cells are screened to identify the best clones that express the protein in high yields. This involves cloning techniques and techniques to select those cells that productively express the target protein.</p><p>This phase is crucial as producing a robust cell line can lead to a more streamlined production process.
2. Upstream Processing
Upstream processing involves the cultivation of the selected cell lines in controlled environments to produce the target biopharmaceutical. This stage can be divided into several steps:</p><p>Media Selection: The choice of growth media greatly influences cell growth and protein yield. Different media are tailored to optimize cell performance and protein production.
Cell Cultivation: Cells can be grown in batch, fed-batch, or continuous processes, with bioreactors providing the needed environment for cell growth. Temperature, pH, and oxygen levels are meticulously monitored and controlled to ensure optimal conditions.
Protein Expression: As the cells grow, they metabolically express the desired proteins. This stage demands rigorous monitoring to ensure that cell viability and protein production rates remain high.</p><p>The quality of the upstream process directly influences the efficiency and productivity of the next stages, making it one of the most critical phases in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.
