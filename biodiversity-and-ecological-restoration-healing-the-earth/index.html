Unsustainable resource extraction leads to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.</p><h3 id=invasive-species>Invasive Species</h3><p>Non-native species introduced intentionally or accidentally can outcompete, prey on, or spread diseases to native species, leading to declines in biodiversity and altering ecosystem functions.</p><h2 id=principles-of-ecological-restoration>Principles of Ecological Restoration</h2><p>Ecological restoration focuses on healing degraded ecosystems by reestablishing native species, restoring natural processes, and enhancing ecosystem functions. Key principles guiding ecological restoration include:</p><h3 id=reference-ecosystems>Reference Ecosystems</h3><p>Restoration efforts often use reference ecosystems—natural, undisturbed habitats—as models for setting restoration goals. These reference ecosystems provide benchmarks for evaluating restoration success and guiding management actions.</p><h3 id=adaptive-management>Adaptive Management</h3><p>Ecological restoration is an iterative process that involves monitoring, evaluating, and adjusting strategies based on observed outcomes. Adaptive management allows practitioners to respond to changing conditions and improve restoration practices over time.</p><h3 id=community-involvement>Community Involvement</h3><p>Engaging local communities in restoration projects fosters a sense of ownership and stewardship, ensuring long-term success. Community involvement can include education, volunteer participation, and collaboration with stakeholders.</p><h3 id=holistic-approach>Holistic Approach</h3><p>Effective restoration considers the entire ecosystem, including its physical, biological, and social components. A holistic approach addresses the root causes of degradation and promotes the recovery of ecological processes and functions.</p><h3 id=biodiversity-conservation>Biodiversity Conservation</h3><p>Restoration efforts prioritize the conservation of native species and genetic diversity. Reintroducing locally adapted species and protecting keystone species—those with a disproportionate impact on ecosystem functions—are essential for restoring biodiversity.</p><h2 id=practices-in-ecological-restoration>Practices in Ecological Restoration</h2><p>Various practices are employed in ecological restoration to address different types of degradation and promote ecosystem recovery:</p><h3 id=reforestation-and-afforestation>Reforestation and Afforestation</h3><p>Reforestation involves replanting native tree species in deforested areas, while afforestation refers to establishing forests in areas that were not previously forested. Both practices enhance biodiversity, sequester carbon, and restore habitat for wildlife.</p><h3 id=wetland-restoration>Wetland Restoration</h3><p>Wetlands provide critical ecosystem services, including water filtration, flood control, and habitat for diverse species. Wetland restoration involves reestablishing hydrological regimes, removing invasive species, and planting native vegetation to improve wetland health.</p><h3 id=grassland-and-savanna-restoration>Grassland and Savanna Restoration</h3><p>Restoring grasslands and savannas often involves controlled grazing, prescribed burns, and reseeding native grasses and wildflowers. These practices help maintain open habitats, support pollinators, and prevent woody plant encroachment.</p><h3 id=river-and-stream-restoration>River and Stream Restoration</h3><p>Restoring rivers and streams focuses on improving water quality, stabilizing banks, and enhancing aquatic habitats. Techniques include removing dams, reestablishing natural flow regimes, and planting riparian vegetation.</p><h3 id=coastal-and-marine-restoration>Coastal and Marine Restoration</h3><p>Coastal and marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrasses, are restored through practices like coral transplantation, mangrove replanting, and reducing pollution.
