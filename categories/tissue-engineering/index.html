Despite advancements in cancer treatment, the prognosis for patients with brain tumors remains poor. Traditional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, often have limited effectiveness and are often accompanied by severe side effects. In recent years, tissue engineering and targeted therapy have emerged as promising approaches for the treatment of brain tumors.
The Challenges of Brain Tumors Brain tumors are a complex and heterogeneous disease, with multiple subtypes and varying degrees of aggressiveness....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;714 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Tissue Engineering and Brain Tumors: Targeted Therapy" href=https://science.googlexy.com/tissue-engineering-and-brain-tumors-targeted-therapy/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
