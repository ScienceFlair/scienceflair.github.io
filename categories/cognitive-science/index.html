Our minds are constantly bombarded with a vast array of sensory information, and yet, we have the remarkable ability to focus on certain aspects while ignoring others. This ability, known as selective perception, is influenced by attentional biases, which play a crucial role in shaping our perception of the world around us. In this blog post, we will delve into the intricate workings of attentional biases, their impact on selective perception, and their significance in the field of cognitive science....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;629 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Cognitive Science and Attentional Biases: Understanding Selective Perception" href=https://science.googlexy.com/cognitive-science-and-attentional-biases-understanding-selective-perception/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
