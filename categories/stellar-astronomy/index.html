How do astronomers measure the vast distances between us and these celestial objects? The answer lies in a fascinating technique called stellar parallax.
What is Stellar Parallax? Stellar parallax is a method used by astronomers to determine the distance to nearby stars. It relies on the phenomenon of apparent shift in a star’s position when observed from different points in Earth’s orbit around the Sun....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;480 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Stellar Parallax: Measuring the Distance to the Stars" href=https://science.googlexy.com/stellar-parallax-measuring-the-distance-to-the-stars/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
