To fully grasp the mechanisms behind climate dynamics and predict future scenarios, scientists are increasingly turning to planetary science—a multidisciplinary field that unravels the mysteries of planets, their atmospheres, and climates within and beyond our solar system. This exploration provides a broader context that enriches our understanding of Earth’s climate, offering fresh perspectives and novel approaches to tackling climate change....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1470 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Role of Planetary Science in Understanding Climate Change on Earth" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-role-of-planetary-science-in-understanding-climate-change-on-earth/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The Role of Planetary Science in Understanding the Early Universe</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>When we think of planetary science, we often envision the study of the planets within our own solar system. However, the implications of planetary science reach far beyond our immediate cosmic neighborhood. In fact, planetary science plays a crucial role in unraveling the mysteries of the early universe, shedding light on the processes that shaped the cosmos as we know it today.

These processes, which include erosion and weathering, are central to understanding how planets evolve over time. In this post, we will dive deep into the science behind these phenomena, exploring how they function, their significance, and their effects on planetary surfaces.
What Are Erosion and Weathering? Both erosion and weathering are processes that cause the breakdown and alteration of rocks and materials on a planetary surface, yet they occur in distinct ways....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1513 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Science of Planetary Surface Processes: Erosion and Weathering" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-science-of-planetary-surface-processes-erosion-and-weathering/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
