These powerful explosions occur when a star reaches the end of its life cycle and undergoes a dramatic collapse. Type Ia supernovae, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their incredible brightness and uniformity. But what exactly triggers these cosmic fireworks? Scientists have long believed that white dwarf mergers play a crucial role in the creation of Type Ia supernovae....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;551 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Role of White Dwarf Mergers in Creating Type Ia Supernovae" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-role-of-white-dwarf-mergers-in-creating-type-ia-supernovae/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
