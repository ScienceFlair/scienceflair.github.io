This fusion has not only revolutionized how we think about clothing but also how fabric can interact with the environment and its wearer. From wearable health monitors to adaptive sports gear, smart textiles are transforming the way we use and experience fabric in everyday life.</p><h2 id=understanding-smart-textiles>Understanding Smart Textiles</h2><p>Smart textiles, also known as intelligent or electronic textiles, are fabrics embedded with digital components such as sensors, microcontrollers, and conductive threads. Unlike conventional textiles, these enhanced fabrics can react to external stimuli—such as temperature, pressure, moisture, or electrical signals—by changing their properties or performing specific functions.</p><p>This capability turns ordinary clothing and textiles into interactive systems that gather data, communicate, and provide real-time responses, blurring the line between fashion, healthcare, sports, and technology.</p><h3 id=categories-of-smart-textiles>Categories of Smart Textiles</h3><p>Smart textiles can be broadly classified into three main types based on their functionality:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Passive Smart Textiles:</strong> These materials are designed to sense environmental conditions without altering their properties. For example, fabrics with sensors that measure temperature or UV exposure fall into this category.</p></li><li><p><strong>Active Smart Textiles:</strong> These textiles actively respond to stimuli by changing their characteristics. Examples include fabrics that adjust insulation based on temperature or light-emitting garments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Very Smart Textiles:</strong> Integrating sensing, actuating, and adaptive capabilities, these textiles can sense, react, and adapt autonomously to changing stimuli. This class often involves complex systems such as self-heating jackets or mood-responsive clothing.</p></li></ul><h2 id=the-technology-behind-smart-textiles>The Technology Behind Smart Textiles</h2><p>Integrating electronics into fabric involves a combination of materials science, electrical engineering, and textile design.
