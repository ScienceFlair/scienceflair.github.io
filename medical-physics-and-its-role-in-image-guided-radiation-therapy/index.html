Achieving this delicate balance requires a deep understanding of radiation interactions, patient anatomy, and machine capabilities — all domains where medical physics shines.</p><p>Medical physicists are responsible for calibrating radiation machines, developing treatment plans, verifying dose distributions, and managing quality assurance routines. They bring expertise in radiation dosimetry, imaging modalities, and computational modeling, which are vital for integrating image guidance into therapy.</p><h2 id=evolution-from-conventional-radiation-therapy-to-igrt>Evolution from Conventional Radiation Therapy to IGRT</h2><p>Traditional radiation therapy often faced challenges stemming from patient movement, organ motion, and setup uncertainties. Image-Guided Radiation Therapy emerged as a solution by incorporating real-time or near real-time imaging into the treatment workflow.</p><p>IGRT allows clinicians to visualize the tumor and adjacent structures immediately before or during radiation delivery. By using modalities such as cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), fluoroscopy, or MRI, the treatment can be adapted to the patient&rsquo;s current anatomy, accounting for changes since simulation.</p><p>This leap forward minimizes positioning errors, reduces radiation to healthy tissue, and improves tumor control rates. The medical physicist orchestrates this complex integration by calibrating imaging devices, merging images with treatment plans, and validating techniques.</p><h2 id=the-core-responsibilities-of-medical-physicists-in-igrt>The Core Responsibilities of Medical Physicists in IGRT</h2><h3 id=quality-assurance-and-equipment-calibration>Quality Assurance and Equipment Calibration</h3><p>Medical physics teams ensure that both the imaging and therapeutic machines operate with the highest accuracy. This involves routine calibration to verify correct radiation output, image resolution, and geometric fidelity.</p><p>Accurate image registration—the alignment between diagnostic images, planning CT scans, and real-time IGRT data—is critical. Physicists design protocols to maintain this alignment, preventing deviations that could compromise treatment effectiveness.</p><h3 id=treatment-planning-and-dose-calculation>Treatment Planning and Dose Calculation</h3><p>One of the pivotal roles of medical physicists is to calculate the precise radiation dose distributions tailored to the tumor&rsquo;s size, shape, and location.
