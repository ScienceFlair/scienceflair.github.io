These systems can also predict the patient’s future progress, allowing healthcare providers to optimize treatment plans and make data-driven decisions.</p><p>Moreover, AI and ML are being integrated into tele-rehabilitation services, which allow patients to receive therapy remotely. With the use of wearable devices, smartphones, and AI-powered platforms, healthcare providers can monitor progress, track movement, and adjust exercises without requiring the patient to be physically present in a clinic. This not only increases accessibility but also provides patients with continuous support and guidance.</p><h3 id=5-virtual-reality-and-augmented-reality>5. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</h3><p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are becoming valuable tools in rehabilitation engineering. These technologies offer immersive, interactive environments that engage patients in a variety of rehabilitation exercises. VR has been used to treat conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and post-surgical recovery by simulating real-world activities, allowing patients to practice movements and tasks in a controlled, virtual environment.</p><p>For example, a stroke patient may use a VR system to practice reaching for virtual objects, helping them regain fine motor skills and coordination. By simulating different environments and scenarios, VR also helps patients stay motivated and engaged throughout their rehabilitation process, improving adherence to therapy.</p><p>AR, on the other hand, enhances the real world by overlaying digital information onto the patient’s environment. AR can be used to guide patients through rehabilitation exercises by providing real-time feedback and instructions. This approach can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of therapy, leading to better outcomes.</p><h3 id=6-wearable-technology-for-continuous-monitoring>6.
