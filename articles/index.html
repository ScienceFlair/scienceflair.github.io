Both erosion and weathering are processes that cause the breakdown and alteration of rocks and materials on a planetary surface, yet they occur in distinct ways....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1513 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Science of Planetary Surface Processes: Erosion and Weathering" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-science-of-planetary-surface-processes-erosion-and-weathering/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>How Meteorites Shape Our Understanding of Planetary Formation</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Meteorites, the rocky and metallic messengers that journey through space to reach Earth, offer invaluable clues about the birth and evolution of planets. Though they might appear as simple space debris, these cosmic relics hold records that reach back billions of years, predating even our solar system. Analyzing meteorites reveals the processes, materials, and timelines involved in planetary formation, deepening our comprehension of the complex dynamics that forged the worlds we see today....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1214 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to How Meteorites Shape Our Understanding of Planetary Formation" href=https://science.googlexy.com/how-meteorites-shape-our-understanding-of-planetary-formation/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The Role of Planetary Science in Understanding Climate Change</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Climate change is a pressing issue that affects every corner of our planet. As temperatures rise, extreme weather events become more frequent, and sea levels continue to rise, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms driving these changes. While Earth-focused research plays a significant role in studying climate change, planetary science offers a unique perspective that can provide valuable insights into this global phenomenon.
Exploring Other Worlds Planetary science involves the study of celestial bodies such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;663 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Role of Planetary Science in Understanding Climate Change" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-role-of-planetary-science-in-understanding-climate-change/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
