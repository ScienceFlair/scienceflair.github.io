Understanding Atmospheric Electricity Atmospheric electricity is primarily the result of the separation of electric charges within clouds and the surrounding atmosphere....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1191 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Science of Atmospheric Electricity: Lightning and Thunderstorms" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-science-of-atmospheric-electricity-lightning-and-thunderstorms/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The Impact of Urbanization on Microclimate and Urban Heat Island Effect</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Urbanization is a global phenomenon that has transformed the way we live. As cities grow and expand, they bring about numerous changes to their surrounding environment, including the microclimate. A microclimate refers to the unique set of weather conditions experienced within a specific area, often influenced by local factors such as topography and vegetation. However, urbanization can significantly alter these microclimates, leading to the formation of what is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;827 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Impact of Urbanization on Microclimate and Urban Heat Island Effect" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-impact-of-urbanization-on-microclimate-and-urban-heat-island-effect/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
