This blog post delves into how DNA influences cellular activities and the processes involved in its replication, shedding light on the intricacies of life at a molecular level....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;955 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Role of DNA in Cell Function and Replication" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-role-of-dna-in-cell-function-and-replication/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The Role of Enzymes in Cellular Metabolism</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>In the intricate symphony of life, every biological process rests upon the foundations of precise, efficient, and coordinated chemical reactions. Among the many remarkable contributors to these processes are enzymes—proteins that catalyze and regulate the chemical reactions necessary to sustain life. Their role in cellular metabolism is indispensable, acting as both enablers and controllers that ensure metabolic pathways proceed at rates conducive to life. From breaking down nutrients to synthesizing biomolecules, enzymes drive nearly all aspects of an organism’s biochemistry....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1285 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Role of Enzymes in Cellular Metabolism" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-role-of-enzymes-in-cellular-metabolism/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
