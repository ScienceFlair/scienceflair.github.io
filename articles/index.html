In the context of urban planning, digital twins simulate entire cities, allowing planners to visualize and analyze various aspects of urban development....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;625 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Urban Planning and Digital Twins: Simulating Cities" href=https://science.googlexy.com/urban-planning-and-digital-twins-simulating-cities/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Designing Noise-Resilient Urban Spaces</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Urban environments are rapidly growing and evolving, bringing with them a host of challenges for both city planners and residents. Among these challenges, noise pollution stands as one of the most pervasive and insidious. In dense cities, where transportation systems, commercial hubs, and high-rise buildings intermingle, noise becomes not just an inconvenience, but a threat to health and well-being. For those who live in or visit urban areas, exposure to persistent noise can lead to stress, sleep disruption, and even long-term cardiovascular issues....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1586 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Designing Noise-Resilient Urban Spaces" href=https://science.googlexy.com/designing-noise-resilient-urban-spaces/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
