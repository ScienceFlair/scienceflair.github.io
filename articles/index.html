Diseases transmitted by vectors can be broadly classified into three categories based on their impact: malaria, arthropod-borne viruses, and bacteria....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;496 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Vector-Borne Diseases: Understanding their Transmission Dynamics and Impacts on Human Health" href=https://science.googlexy.com/vector-borne-diseases-understanding-their-transmission-dynamics-and-impacts-on-human-health/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Ecological Factors in Antibiotic Resistance: Examining Environmental Drivers of Resistance</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Antibiotic resistance is a pressing global health concern, posing a significant challenge to the treatment of infectious diseases. While the role of clinical antibiotic use in driving resistance is well-documented, the influence of ecological factors on the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is an area of growing interest and concern. In this blog post, we will explore the intricate interplay of environmental drivers in shaping antibiotic resistance, shedding light on the complex dynamics that contribute to this critical issue....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;679 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Ecological Factors in Antibiotic Resistance: Examining Environmental Drivers of Resistance" href=https://science.googlexy.com/ecological-factors-in-antibiotic-resistance-examining-environmental-drivers-of-resistance/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
