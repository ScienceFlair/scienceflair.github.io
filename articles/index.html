The Microbial Universe Within Microbes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, are present in every nook and cranny of the animal body....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;789 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Microbes and the Role of Probiotics in Animal Health" href=https://science.googlexy.com/microbes-and-the-role-of-probiotics-in-animal-health/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Antimicrobial Stewardship: Best Practices in Healthcare</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Antimicrobial resistance stands as one of the paramount challenges in modern medicine, threatening to undermine decades of progress in treating infectious diseases. The rise of drug-resistant bacteria and fungi demands a coordinated and strategic approach to the use of antimicrobial agents within healthcare settings. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs are the frontline defense, designed to optimize the use of antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals to improve patient outcomes, preserve drug efficacy, and reduce the spread of resistance....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1203 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Antimicrobial Stewardship: Best Practices in Healthcare" href=https://science.googlexy.com/antimicrobial-stewardship-best-practices-in-healthcare/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Phage Therapy: Using Viruses to Combat Bacterial Infections</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>In an era where antibiotic resistance is becoming an increasingly urgent public health challenge, researchers are looking for innovative solutions to fight bacterial infections. One such promising alternative is phage therapy, a treatment method that uses viruses known as bacteriophages to target and kill harmful bacteria. This approach, which dates back to the early 20th century, is gaining renewed interest as a potential solution to the global crisis of antibiotic-resistant bacteria....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1537 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Phage Therapy: Using Viruses to Combat Bacterial Infections" href=https://science.googlexy.com/phage-therapy-using-viruses-to-combat-bacterial-infections/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://science.googlexy.com/>All the science is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
