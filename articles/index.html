Robotics, the fusion of engineering, computer science, and mechanics, relies heavily on physics principles to create intelligent machines that can perform complex tasks autonomously or in collaboration with humans. Whether it’s designing a robotic arm that perfectly mimics human movement or programming a drone to navigate unpredictable environments, the laws of physics are indispensable to achieving functionality, efficiency, and innovation in robotics....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1232 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The Role of Physics in Robotics: Creating Intelligent Machines" href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-role-of-physics-in-robotics-creating-intelligent-machines/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The Physics of Space Travel: Challenges and Possibilities</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Space travel has always captured the human imagination, fueling dreams of exploring the unknown and expanding our presence beyond Earth. However, the physics of space travel present a myriad of challenges and possibilities that are as complex as they are fascinating.
