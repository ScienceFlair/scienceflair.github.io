From the depths of the oceans to the highest mountaintops, predators regulate populations of prey species, prevent overgrazing, and promote biodiversity. Yet, their importance is often overlooked or misunderstood. In this article, we will explore the vital role of predators in ecosystems, the threats they face, and the importance of conservation efforts to protect these apex predators. Predators are keystone species, meaning they have a disproportionately large impact on the structure and function of ecosystems....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;488 words</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Predators: Balancing Earth's Ecosystems" href=https://science.googlexy.com/predators-balancing-earths-ecosystems/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The Influence of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on Global Weather</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a natural climate phenomenon that occurs in the Pacific Ocean. It involves the interaction between the ocean surface temperatures and the atmosphere, leading to significant changes in weather patterns across the globe. ENSO has a profound influence on various aspects of our planet’s climate system, affecting everything from rainfall patterns to temperature fluctuations.
