The agency evaluates the safety and efficacy of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), biologics, and other biotechnological products before they can enter the market.</p></li><li><p><strong>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</strong>: The EPA regulates the environmental aspects of biotechnology, including the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment. This agency assesses potential ecological impacts and ensures compliance with environmental laws.</p></li><li><p><strong>United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)</strong>: The USDA oversees the regulation of genetically modified crops and livestock. Its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) evaluates the safety of GMOs before they can be cultivated or imported.</p></li><li><p><strong>European Medicines Agency (EMA)</strong>: In the European Union, the EMA regulates biotechnology products similar to the FDA. It ensures that biologics and gene therapies meet stringent safety and efficacy standards.</p></li><li><p><strong>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</strong>: The NIH provides guidance and oversight for research involving genetically modified organisms, particularly in biomedical research. It establishes ethical guidelines and funding criteria for research projects.</p></li></ol><h3 id=the-regulatory-framework>The Regulatory Framework</h3><p>The regulatory framework for biotechnology can be complex, as it involves multiple layers of legislation at the international, national, and local levels. Here are some of the key components:</p><h4 id=1-risk-assessment-and-management>1. <strong>Risk Assessment and Management</strong></h4><p>Risk assessment is a critical component of biotechnology regulation. Regulatory agencies evaluate potential risks associated with biotechnological products, considering factors such as environmental impact, human health, and ethical concerns.
