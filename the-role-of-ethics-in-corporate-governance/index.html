It encompasses the relationships between a company&rsquo;s management, board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders. While corporate governance primarily focuses on the legal and financial aspects of a company&rsquo;s operations, it is essential to recognize the crucial role ethics plays in this framework.</p><p>Ethics in corporate governance refers to the moral principles and values that guide a company&rsquo;s behavior and decision-making process. It sets the tone for the company&rsquo;s culture, shapes its reputation, and influences how it interacts with its employees, shareholders, customers, and the wider society. Ultimately, ethics is the foundation upon which trust and credibility are built.</p><h2 id=the-importance-of-ethical-corporate-governance>The Importance of Ethical Corporate Governance</h2><p>In today&rsquo;s business landscape, where scandals and corporate misconduct have become all too common, the role of ethics in corporate governance has gained paramount importance.
