In financial markets, feedback loops occur when market participants react to price changes, leading to further price adjustments. For instance, if a stock&rsquo;s price rises, more investors may buy in, causing the price to rise further—a classic positive feedback loop. Conversely, negative feedback loops may stabilize prices when they become too volatile.</p></li><li><p><strong>System Dynamics</strong>: Financial markets are complex systems characterized by numerous interdependent components. Cybernetics provides tools to model these systems, helping analysts visualize how various elements—such as economic indicators, investor sentiment, and geopolitical events—interact over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptation and Learning</strong>: Just as living organisms adapt to their environments, financial systems must respond to changing market conditions.
