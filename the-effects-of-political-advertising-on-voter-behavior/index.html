While ads can inspire civic engagement and support for candidates, they can also contribute to division and misinformation. Understanding how political advertising works and its influence on voting decisions is crucial for making informed choices at the ballot box.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://science.googlexy.com/categories/political-science/>Political Science</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://science.googlexy.com/the-economics-of-political-decision-making/><span class=title>Â« Prev</span><br><span>The Economics of Political Decision-Making</span>
