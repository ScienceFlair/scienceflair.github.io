The requirement, looming within the Hyde Amendment, prohibited federal funding for abortion services under Title X programs, conducing an ongoing argument between abortion rights and access perspectives. Despite the controversy, health clinics and organizations sustaining their activities, providing necessities through contracted and kinship projects.
