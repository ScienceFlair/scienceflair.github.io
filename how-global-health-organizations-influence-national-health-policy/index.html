By leveraging their collective expertise, global health organizations have the power to inform and influence national health policy decisions.
The significance of global health organizations cannot be overstated. They not only provide access to essential resources and medications in resource-scarce settings but also help build healthcare infrastructure in underserved communities. For instance, organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) have spearheaded efforts to combat infectious diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. By harmonizing national health policies, regulating drugs and vaccines, and facilitating the sharing of knowledge and best practices, global health organizations have made a significant impact.
Leading Global Health Organizations and their Impact</p><ol><li><p>World Health Organization (WHO)
Established in 1948, the World Health Organization plays a pivotal role in promoting health, keeping the world safe, and serving the vulnerable. Its quadrennial agendas for global health policy provide a framework for promoting health, safety, and well-being. WHO's role in promoting non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has been a significant area of focus. According to the WHO's 2020 reports, NCDs account for some 43.8 million deaths worldwide each year.
The WHO's engagement in crisis situations continues to underscore its essential role in public health. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO coordinated timely and essential research efforts. WHO scientists and experts published critical guidelines for rapid response to new disease outbreaks. Data available through the Global Infection Source indicated over 533.3 million reported cases.
