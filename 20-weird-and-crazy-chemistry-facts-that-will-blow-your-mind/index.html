It&rsquo;s responsible for the colorful sunsets we enjoy, the food we eat, and the very air we breathe. In this engaging blog post, we will delve into some mind-blowing and weird chemistry facts that will leave you spellbound. From the incredible human body to the cosmos beyond, chemistry is not as boring as you might think!</p><ol><li><p><strong>Do you have gold in your stomach?</strong>
The human body contains trace amounts of gold. This fact might sound unbelievable, but it&rsquo;s true. About 0.002mg of gold exists in the average human body. Interestingly, it&rsquo;s mostly found in radioactive gold 190, which is found in the body&rsquo;s tissues and decays over time. Quite fascinating, right?</p></li><li><p><strong>Antifreeze is safe for humans.</strong>
Antifreeze is typically toxic for humans, containing ethylene glycol. However, it&rsquo;s safe to consume in small amounts, as it can be metabolized by the body. Manufacturers produce “poison bottles” of antifreeze containing a bright blue or green dye that helps identify the poisonous substance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fingernails grow faster after a shower.</strong>
Just as the world of chemistry sweeps in and takes over your mind, let this fact leave you in awe. It&rsquo;s been proven that nail growth increases by about ten percent after exposure to warm water, especially showers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Natural gas is mostly made of methane.</strong>
If you didn&rsquo;t know, methane is a hydrocarbon that forms the major component of natural gas. It&rsquo;s the simplest alkane, with the chemical formula CH4. It&rsquo;s so inflammable that it&rsquo;s a significant contributor to global warming, due to the greenhouse effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bleach and ammonia together?</strong>
Don&rsquo;t try this at home! Mixing bleach with ammonia results in a toxic fume that&rsquo;s downright dangerous. This mixture produces chloramine gas, which is highly corrosive, can cause burns, and may trigger asthma attacks, among other health problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Humangresql to handle six times more information in a lifetime.</strong>
Did you know that the human brain loses as much as 80% of its neurons during a lifetime? Initially, this might seem like a bad sign, but worry not, as it&rsquo;s proven that our brains compensate for this loss by strengthening the remaining connections. This process helps the brain to continue handling more complex tasks throughout life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Butterflies taste with their feet.</strong>
The next time you spot a beautiful butterfly, take a moment to appreciate its seemingly magical world. An extraordinary fact about the fluttering wonders is the capacity of their feet to taste. How? They possess taste receptors on their feet that help them identify suitable plants for their meals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cheese is 100% fat.</strong>
Cheese is undoubtedly delicious, but let&rsquo;s be real. It&rsquo;s not the healthiest food out there. Did you know that virtually all natural cheese is made from 100% fat? The difference in their calorie content comes down to the water and protein content.</p></li><li><p><strong>The lining of a squid’s ink sac is porous.</strong>
Ever wondered why the ink cloud of a squid is dark and visible from the surface? The ink&rsquo;s color isn&rsquo;t from a pigment. Instead, it dilutes the oxygen in the ink, causing it to appear dark.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pickles don’t spoil.</strong>
Everything in nature is interconnected, and chemistry is behind every process, including the preservation of pickles. Vinegar in the pickling process kills most bacteria and other microorganisms that cause spoilage, allowing pickles to keep for a long time.</p></li><li><p><strong>The human body temperature is the perfect solvent for biochemical reactions.</strong>
Your body temperature averages 98.6°F, and this temperature is just perfect for biochemical reactions to occur. The physics of fluids dictate that 37°C (98.6°F) is the ideal temperature for reactions relying on enzymes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Religious incense contains mercury.</strong>
Ever thought about the chemistry of religious incense? Frankincense is made from oil extracted from the sap of the Boswellia tree. An essential ingredient in the mixture is volatile organic compounds, including a heavy dose of tiny balls of mercury.</p></li><li><p><strong>Some plastics excrete a chemical that mimics the pheromones of recruits.</strong>
Chemical engineers have discovered that some plastics excrete compounds that are chemically similar to pheromones of slower bees to attract quicker worker bees, and this helps bolster their colonies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.</strong>
Though we expected this fact, it&rsquo;s crucial that we acknowledge it to fully realize how fascinating chemistry genuinely is. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius and freezes at 0 degrees Celsius due to its unique molecular structure.</p></li><li><p><strong>The coelacanth is almost all cartilage.</strong>
Did you know that documentaries sometimes feature the coelacanth because it looks like a living fossil? Most of it is not bone, but instead, cartilage.</p></li><li><p><strong>We have more bacteria in our bodies than actual human cells.</strong>
Our outer environment differences might overshadow our inner ecosystems but be aware of the microscopic world within us. In fact, the research came out that the bacteria residing within the human body outnumber human cells roughly 10:1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Our bodies can’t handle pure oxygen.</strong>
It&rsquo;s ironic that we need air to breathe to survive, yet it&rsquo;s not pure oxygen, which could be lethal to us. Pure oxygen supports combustion, so if our bodies were exposed to it, it could result in internal fires.</p></li><li><p><strong>Octopuses have three hearts.</strong>
They are fascinating cephalopods with unique features. Three hearts are essential for them to maintain their tenacity and robust circulatory systems, as they require a suitable water temperature to conduct their activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>A jellyfish is almost completely made of water.</strong>
Jellyfish are notorious for looking like blobs of gelatinous mass. Though they may appear harmless, nearly 98% of their bodies is water.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plants are green because of their smartphone-sized organelles.</strong>
The tiny chloroplasts within the chlorophyll in plants give them their green pigment. These chloroplasts are similar in size to your smartphone and date back to 3 billion years ago when they were once part of a photosynthetic bacterium.</p></li></ol><p>In conclusion, chemistry continues to be an endlessly fascinating subject, full of intriguing discoveries that make you question the world around you. These 20 weird and incredible chemistry facts alone should spark curiosity and motivate you to dive deeper into this beguiling field.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://science.googlexy.com/categories/chemistry/>Chemistry</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://science.googlexy.com/10-essential-chemistry-experiments-you-must-try-at-home/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 Essential Chemistry Experiments You Must Try at Home</span>
