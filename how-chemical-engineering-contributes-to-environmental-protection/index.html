Chemical engineers contribute significantly to efforts that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. CCS involves capturing CO2 emissions from industrial sources, such as power plants, and sequestering them in geological formations underground to prevent their release into the atmosphere.</p><p>Chemical engineers design highly efficient capture materials, such as amine-based scrubbing systems, that bind carbon dioxide from emissions streams. Additionally, they are innovating in the field of solid sorbents and membrane technologies to refine the capture process. Once CO2 is captured, engineering expertise is used to compress, transport, and inject it into secure storage sites such as saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs.</p><p>Emerging carbon utilization technologies are also gaining traction, turning captured CO2 into valuable products. For example, chemical engineers are working on processes to convert CO2 into synthetic fuels, concrete additives, and polymers. These initiatives not only address carbon emissions but also create economic incentives to support sustainable practices.</p><h2 id=circular-economy-and-resource-recovery>Circular Economy and Resource Recovery</h2><p>The concept of a circular economy seeks to eliminate waste by keeping resources in continuous use. Chemical engineering plays a prominent role in closing the resource loop through recycling, reclamation, and resource recovery technologies. By designing systems that extract usable materials from waste products, engineers are reducing raw material consumption and promoting sustainability.</p><p>Plastics recycling, for instance, has been an area of intense research. Traditional mechanical recycling methods degrade plastic quality over time, limiting their reuse potential. Chemical engineers are pioneering chemical recycling techniques, like depolymerization, which break plastics back down into their molecular constituents. These materials can then be used to create new plastics of equal quality, effectively closing the loop.</p><p>In addition to plastics, chemical engineers develop processes for recovering precious metals from electronic waste, such as lithium, cobalt, and gold.
