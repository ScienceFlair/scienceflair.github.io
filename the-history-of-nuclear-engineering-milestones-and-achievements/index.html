In 1896, French physicist Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted radiation without an external source of energy. This groundbreaking finding laid the foundation for future research into atomic structure and nuclear reactions.</p><p>In the following years, scientists such as Marie Curie and her husband Pierre contributed significantly to our understanding of radioactivity. Their work on radium and polonium not only advanced the field of nuclear physics but also opened the door to potential applications in medicine and energy.</p><h2 id=theoretical-foundations-the-development-of-nuclear-physics>Theoretical Foundations: The Development of Nuclear Physics</h2><p>As the 20th century dawned, the theoretical underpinnings of nuclear physics began to take shape. In 1938, German physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann conducted experiments that led to the discovery of nuclear fission. They found that when uranium nuclei were bombarded with neutrons, they split into lighter elements, releasing a substantial amount of energy in the process. This discovery was pivotal, as it demonstrated that the nucleus held vast amounts of energy that could be harnessed for practical use.</p><p>Following this discovery, physicist Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch provided a theoretical explanation for fission, describing the process and its implications. Their work not only helped clarify the mechanics of nuclear reactions but also laid the groundwork for future advancements in nuclear engineering.</p><h2 id=the-manhattan-project-engineering-for-war>The Manhattan Project: Engineering for War</h2><p>The onset of World War II marked a turning point in the field of nuclear engineering. Fearing that Nazi Germany would develop nuclear weapons, the United States initiated the Manhattan Project in 1942. This massive research and development program aimed to create atomic bombs.</p><p>Led by prominent scientists, including J. Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi, the project resulted in the construction of the first nuclear reactors and the development of two types of atomic bombs: &ldquo;Little Boy,&rdquo; which was dropped on Hiroshima, and &ldquo;Fat Man,&rdquo; which was dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. The success of the Manhattan Project not only showcased the potential of nuclear energy but also ushered in the atomic age, profoundly influencing global politics and military strategy.</p><h2 id=post-war-era-harnessing-nuclear-power-for-peace>Post-War Era: Harnessing Nuclear Power for Peace</h2><p>After the devastation of World War II, the focus shifted from weapons development to the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. The first commercial nuclear power plant, the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, began operation in Pennsylvania in 1958. This marked a significant milestone in the history of nuclear engineering, demonstrating that nuclear energy could be harnessed to generate electricity for civilian use.</p><p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, nuclear power gained momentum as a viable energy source. Countries around the world began constructing nuclear power plants, recognizing their potential to provide a stable and efficient energy supply. By the late 1970s, nuclear energy accounted for a significant portion of electricity generation in several countries, including the United States, France, and Canada.</p><h2 id=safety-and-regulation-learning-from-accidents>Safety and Regulation: Learning from Accidents</h2><p>As nuclear power expanded, so did concerns about safety and the potential for catastrophic accidents.
