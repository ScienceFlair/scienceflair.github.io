This unique characteristic has sparked significant interest across various industries, from healthcare and biotechnology to electronics and environmental science. The potential applications of stimuli-responsive materials are vast and continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into their properties and capabilities.
The concept of stimuli-responsive materials is rooted in the idea of creating materials that can dynamically alter their physical or chemical properties in response to specific triggers. These triggers can be external, such as changes in temperature or exposure to light, or internal, such as variations in pH levels within the body. By harnessing the ability to manipulate these materials on demand, scientists and engineers are opening doors to a wide array of innovative applications.</p><h3 id=healthcare-and-biotechnology>Healthcare and Biotechnology</h3><p>In the field of healthcare, stimuli-responsive materials hold immense promise for targeted drug delivery systems.
