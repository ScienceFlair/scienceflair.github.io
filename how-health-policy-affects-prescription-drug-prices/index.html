The main culprits, it often seems, are pharmaceutical companies and their greedy pricing strategies. However, the reality is far more complex, and health policy plays a significant role in shaping prescription drug costs. In this post, we'll delve into the intricacies of the relationship between health policy and prescription drug prices.
The Pendulum of Policy: How Permissive Regulations Can Fuel Price Increases
The United States has a long history of permissive regulatory policies that have allowed the pharmaceutical industry to flourish. The 1984 Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, which exempted mergers and acquisitions of pharma companies from antitrust review, laid the groundwork for the industry's consolidation. This consolidation has led to fewer, more powerful pharma companies that can dictate prices, contributing to skyrocketing costs.
The Medicaid pic and Game of Price Concessions
In the 1990s, pharmaceutical companies began offering discounts and rebates to Medicaid, which had been created under Title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to low-income families. These price concessions were initially voluntary but quickly became mandatory through state-by-state negotiations. As more states entered into these agreements, discount prices became the norm, but it raised questions about the long-term viability of this system.
The Center Stage: Medicare and the Impact of Part D
With the passage of Medicare Part D in 2003, the stage was set for a major shift in the pharma landscape. This program, which provides coverage for medication to elderly Americans, was instrumental in liberalizing the patient assistance program landscape. As more Americans entered the program, pharma companies saw a massive growth in diabetes, cholesterol, and other medication prescriptions, driving up costs even further.
The Unsung Heroes of Health Policy: How Government Programs Can Rein in Costs
One of the lesser-known aspects of health policy is its role in tempering pharma costs. Programs such as Medicaid, the Veterans Administration, and Medicare have built-in mechanisms that help control costs. For instance, the control prices they set for Medicare ensure that negotiated prices do not exceed negotiated ceiling prices. These programs take the biggest chunk of overall pharma spending but spend less on prescription drugs than private payers due to this natural tug-of-war over discounted costs.
Interest: How Lobbying Influences Health Policy
The pharmaceutical industry has historically been a significant lobbying force in America's capital. In 2019, pharma companies spent over $220 million in lobbying fees to protect and expand product patent durations. Their aggregate slogan of augmenting patent immigration and free patent debate trial payouts plays down insurance products skipped over multi-level judges aimed to reduce yearly denominator inflations depending advertising natural emit movements residual advertising quality costs overshadowless substantial reliability interest standard.
