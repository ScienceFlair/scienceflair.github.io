Rising temperatures can lead to increased evaporation, reduced water flow, and altered precipitation patterns, all of which can affect the health of water systems. Warmer waters can also lower oxygen levels, making it more difficult for certain species to survive. Climate change can also alter the distribution of species, disrupting ecosystems and the services they provide.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://science.googlexy.com/categories/biodiversity/>Biodiversity</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://science.googlexy.com/biodiversity-and-water-quality-the-hidden-connection/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Biodiversity and Water Quality: The Hidden Connection</span>
