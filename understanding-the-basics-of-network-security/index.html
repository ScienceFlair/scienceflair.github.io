Authentication</strong></h3><p>Authentication involves verifying that the entity (user, device, service) accessing the system is who or what it claims to be. Passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and digital certificates are common methods used to achieve authentication.</p><h3 id=5-non-repudiation><strong>5. Non-repudiation</strong></h3><p>Non-repudiation ensures that actions performed on a network or system cannot later be disputed. Digital signatures are frequently used to provide this level of accountability, ensuring that users cannot deny their actions.</p><h2 id=common-threats-to-network-security>Common Threats to Network Security</h2><p>Understanding the threats to network security is key to building effective defenses. Cyber threats come in many forms, with each posing a unique challenge.</p><h3 id=1-malware><strong>1. Malware</strong></h3><p>Malicious software, or malware, includes viruses, worms, spyware, and ransomware. Malware infiltrates a system to steal data, damage files, or take control of devices. It often spreads through email attachments, malicious links, or infected software downloads.</p><h3 id=2-phishing><strong>2. Phishing</strong></h3><p>Phishing involves fraudulent attempts to deceive users into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials or payment details. These attacks often appear as legitimate emails or messages.</p><h3 id=3-man-in-the-middle-mitm-attacks><strong>3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks</strong></h3><p>MITM attacks occur when a cybercriminal intercepts communications between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker can eavesdrop, alter, or steal data during the exchange.</p><h3 id=4-ddos-attacks><strong>4. DDoS Attacks</strong></h3><p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks flood a network or service with excessive traffic, rendering it unreachable to legitimate users. These attacks are often used to disrupt operations or extort organizations.</p><h3 id=5-insider-threats><strong>5. Insider Threats</strong></h3><p>Insider threats involve individuals within an organization misusing their access privileges. These threats can arise from employees intentionally leaking information or unintentionally creating vulnerabilities.</p><h3 id=6-zero-day-vulnerabilities><strong>6. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</strong></h3><p>A zero-day vulnerability is a security flaw in software or hardware that is unknown to the vendor. Cybercriminals exploit these vulnerabilities until a patch or solution is available, making them highly dangerous.</p><h2 id=essential-network-security-technologies-and-measures>Essential Network Security Technologies and Measures</h2><p>To defend against a wide array of threats, organizations and individuals utilize various security technologies and practices.</p><h3 id=1-firewalls><strong>1.
