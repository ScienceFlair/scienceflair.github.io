Every interaction reveals a new outcome, leading to multiple endings and layers of complexity.</p><p>The 3D VR version enhances the experience, allowing you to interact with the objects and clues in a more tangible way. From cryptic codes scribbled on the walls to hidden mechanisms in plain sight, the game constantly tests your ability to think critically and piece together the big picture.</p><h2 id=7-trover-saves-the-universe><strong>7. Trover Saves the Universe</strong></h2><p>While primarily an action-platformer with comedic elements, Trover Saves the Universe incorporates various puzzles that break up the gameplay and keep things engaging.
