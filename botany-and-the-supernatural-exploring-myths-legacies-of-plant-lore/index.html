They have been a source of sustenance, medicine, art, and tradition. But beyond the practical benefits, plants have often been associated with the supernatural, contributing to the rich tapestry of myths and legends. In this blog post, we will dive into the intricate connection between botanical science and the supernatural - traveling through the realms of dreams, folklore, and mysteries that surround these green wonders.</p><h2 id=the-supernatural-touch-plant-psi-abilities-and-telepathy>The Supernatural Touch: Plant psi abilities and telepathy</h2><p>It&rsquo;s not every day we think of plants as being telepathic or possessing psychic abilities. However, many ancient civilizations believed in such prodigious traits in plants. From India, where the Banyan tree was believed to possess the power to absorb and transmit desires, to the Native American legends of Talking Stick, imbued with the power to give the carrier influence in council, the world of plant lore is peppered with claims of plant extrasensory perception.</p><p>Recent studies in plant science have also lent credence to these ancient claims. Studies have shown that plants communicate with each other using chemical signals, and when one of their kin is under attack, the surrounding plants emit a warning pheromone to help in defense. Now, wouldn’t that be a form of telepathy?</p><p>If that’s not intriguing enough, it has been observed that plants experience a phenomenon known as the &lsquo;plant behavior response.&rsquo; This happens when plants grow in curved or patterned shapes that seem to mimic their surroundings. These patterns are surprisingly similar to those appearing in the skies during super solar flares or earthbound geoglyphs; indicating that perhaps, plants possess an innate comprehension of gravity and patterns.</p><h2 id=the-temporal-gardens-space-time-manipulation-and-prophetic-dreams>The Temporal Gardens: Space-time manipulation and prophetic dreams</h2><p>The concept of time or rather timelessness holds a central place in the myths associated with certain plants. For instance, the Moringa tree found in certain parts of Africa is revered as the &lsquo;Tree of Life&rsquo; because of its ability to supposedly transport one through time when its seeds are consumed.</p><p>Similarly, vast forests are believed to hold threshold places or wormholes called &rsquo;ley lines,&rsquo; which according to many pagans, shamans, and believers of the supernatural, could bend time in such a way that one could interact with parallel worlds within.</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s the Sacred Saguaro with its arms outstretched toward the starlit sky or the mysterious circle of standing stones erected around ancient burial sites, these seemingly barren landscapes are deemed to conceal secrets held by plants.</p><p>French philosophy further supports the idea that there is &rsquo;temporal potentiality&rsquo; present within a handful of flowers and trees, influencing our dreams and subconscious thoughts. Thus, it isn&rsquo;t uncommon for plants to appear in prophetic visions, guiding dreamers towards hidden cures, sudden bursts of knowledge, or warnings about imminent disasters.</p><h2 id=the-enigmatic-roots-plant-spirits-entities-and-guardians>The Enigmatic Roots: Plant spirits, entities and guardians</h2><p>In many different mythologies, plants aren&rsquo;t just passive spectators, but instead are active participants in the cosmos with their own spirits or entities guarding them from enemies.</p><p>For example, ancient Egyptians believed in the existence of Tree Spirits guarding the gates of death and rebirth - the protective spirits believed that watching over the deceased as they travel towards the afterlife.</p><p>Similarly, Japanese folklore talks about the spirit of the Wisteria tree (Fuji) - a benevolent deity that embodies the connection between love, ecstasy, and sorrow, a perfect representation of the ever-changing nature of emotions.</p><p>In Native American Culture, the Great Spirit is said to have a close bond with the sacred White Buffalo tree, which is a source of sacred wisdom and healing.</p><p>Trees, in particular, are considered by many as earth-bound beings with strong ties to the spirit world. Hence, they serve as ideal places for spiritual communion in numerous shamanic cultures.</p><h2 id=the-medicine-witches-and-the-witch-doctors-healing-powers-of-plants>The Medicine Witches and The Witch Doctors: Healing powers of plants</h2><p>The world of botany is closely linked with the practice of medicine and witchcraft. The African continent, for instance, has always thrived with traditional healers or &lsquo;Witch Doctors,&rsquo; who wield plant-based medicines to treat diseases and harm.</p><p>The use of natural remedies is not limited to Africa - the Ayurvedic healing system in India, the traditional Chinese medicine, and European herbalism all rely on plants for their healing potential.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>To sum up, science and myths have both pointed us towards obscure corners of the botanical world. Woven through the entire spectrum of cultural histories and supernatural belief systems, lie accounts inspired by plants; mystical forests, messages in dreams, and ethereal gardens that stretch far across time. Researching and understanding the plant lore and legends that persist centuries later enhances our botanical knowledge and provides us with novel perspectives on the natural world.</p><p>Thus, drawing a line between the realms botany and the supernatural, we can begin to comprehend both with new levels of curiosity and wonder, enriching the knowledge of plant life ,while opening a pathway to the unknown. Let us embrace the stories, beliefs, and wisdom bound by the perplexing enigma of plant lore, for in understanding their secrets, we may unveil some elusive connections buried within their magical worlds.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://science.googlexy.com/categories/botany/>Botany</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://science.googlexy.com/botany-and-the-art-of-fermentation-discovering-the-magic-of-plant-made-beverages/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Botany and the Art of Fermentation: Discovering the Magic of Plant-Made Beverages</span>
