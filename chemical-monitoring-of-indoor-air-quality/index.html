These pollutants can be categorized into gases, particulates, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), each of which can pose different risks to health.</p><h3 id=1-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs>1. <strong>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</strong></h3><p>VOCs are a group of chemicals that can easily evaporate into the air at room temperature. They are commonly found in household products such as paints, cleaning agents, air fresheners, and even furniture. Some common VOCs include:</p><ul><li><strong>Formaldehyde</strong>: Found in building materials, furniture, and tobacco smoke, formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and can cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat.</li><li><strong>Benzene</strong>: Often found in paints and solvents, benzene can cause dizziness, headaches, and, in the long term, increase the risk of cancer.</li><li><strong>Toluene and Xylene</strong>: These chemicals are present in many household cleaners and adhesives and can cause respiratory issues and dizziness.</li></ul><h3 id=2-particulate-matter-pm>2. <strong>Particulate Matter (PM)</strong></h3><p>Particulate matter refers to tiny particles suspended in the air, which can be inhaled and cause health problems. These particles can range from large dust particles to microscopic pollutants like soot and smoke. Common sources of particulate matter include:</p><ul><li><strong>Cigarette smoke</strong>: Tobacco smoke contains a mixture of harmful chemicals, including carbon monoxide, nicotine, and particulate matter.</li><li><strong>Cooking</strong>: The burning of oil and food during cooking can release particulate matter into the air, especially in poorly ventilated kitchens.</li><li><strong>Dust and pet dander</strong>: These common allergens can accumulate in homes, leading to respiratory issues and aggravating asthma.</li></ul><h3 id=3-gases-and-aerosols>3. <strong>Gases and Aerosols</strong></h3><p>Indoor air can also contain harmful gases and aerosols that can affect health. Some of the most concerning gases include:</p><ul><li><strong>Carbon monoxide (CO)</strong>: A colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuels like gas stoves, fireplaces, and heating systems. Exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can be fatal.</li><li><strong>Carbon dioxide (CO2)</strong>: While CO2 is naturally present in the air, high concentrations can lead to headaches, dizziness, and reduced cognitive function.</li><li><strong>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)</strong>: This gas is often found in homes with gas appliances and can irritate the respiratory system.</li></ul><h2 id=methods-for-monitoring-indoor-air-quality>Methods for Monitoring Indoor Air Quality</h2><p>There are several methods available for chemical monitoring of indoor air quality. These techniques can be used to measure the concentration of various pollutants and determine whether air quality is within acceptable limits. The choice of monitoring method depends on the specific pollutants being assessed and the desired level of accuracy.</p><h3 id=1-passive-sampling>1. <strong>Passive Sampling</strong></h3><p>Passive sampling involves the use of absorbent materials, such as filters or tubes, to capture pollutants over a specified period. These samples are then analyzed in a laboratory to determine the concentration of specific chemicals. Passive sampling is a low-cost, simple method that can be used for long-term monitoring. However, it may not provide real-time data and is less effective for measuring short-term fluctuations in pollutant levels.</p><h3 id=2-active-sampling>2. <strong>Active Sampling</strong></h3><p>Active sampling involves the use of pumps to draw air through a collection medium, such as a filter or absorbent material. This method is more accurate than passive sampling and is often used for real-time monitoring of pollutants. Active sampling allows for the continuous measurement of air quality and is ideal for assessing short-term exposure to harmful chemicals.</p><h3 id=3-real-time-monitoring-systems>3. <strong>Real-Time Monitoring Systems</strong></h3><p>Real-time monitoring systems use advanced sensors to continuously measure the concentration of pollutants in the air.
