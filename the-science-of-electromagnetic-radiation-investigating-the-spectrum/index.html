These waves do not require a medium to propagate, allowing them to travel through the vacuum of space. The behavior of electromagnetic radiation is described by Maxwell&rsquo;s equations, formulated by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century, which unify electricity, magnetism, and optics into a single framework.</p><h3 id=properties-of-electromagnetic-waves>Properties of Electromagnetic Waves</h3><p>Electromagnetic waves possess several key properties:</p><ul><li><strong>Wavelength (λ)</strong>: The distance between successive peaks of a wave, measured in meters. It determines the type of electromagnetic radiation.</li><li><strong>Frequency (f)</strong>: The number of oscillations of the wave that pass a point in one second, measured in hertz (Hz). Frequency and wavelength are inversely related; as one increases, the other decreases.</li><li><strong>Speed (c)</strong>: Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately (3 \times 10^8) meters per second.</li></ul><p>These properties are interconnected through the equation:</p><p>[
c = f \cdot \lambda
]</p><p>This equation illustrates that the speed of light is equal to the product of the frequency and wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Understanding these properties is crucial to investigating the electromagnetic spectrum and its various applications.</p><h2 id=the-electromagnetic-spectrum>The Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2><p>The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all types of electromagnetic radiation, categorized by wavelength and frequency.
