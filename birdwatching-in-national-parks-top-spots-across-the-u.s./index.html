For birding enthusiasts, national parks across the United States provide unparalleled opportunities to spot incredible avian species, from majestic eagles to delicate warblers. These protected areas are safe havens for an astounding diversity of birds, making them premier destinations for both novice and seasoned birdwatchers alike. Whether you’re seeking to add rare species to your life list or simply revel in the beauty of birdsong, here are some of the top national parks to visit and what makes them stand out for birdwatching.</p><h2 id=acadia-national-park-maine>Acadia National Park, Maine</h2><p>With its rugged cliffs, lush forests, and tranquil coastal waters, Acadia National Park is one of the best spots on the East Coast for observing migratory and resident bird species. The park serves as a critical stopover point for birds traveling along the Atlantic Flyway, especially during migration seasons in spring and fall.</p><p>Common sightings include the charismatic puffins along the coast, black-capped chickadees in the forests, and warblers flitting through the trees. Bald eagles and peregrine falcons are frequently spotted in the skies, a rewarding sight for bird enthusiasts. For an unforgettable birdwatching experience, head to the Sieur de Monts area or the noontide expanse of Jordan Pond, where you may catch glimpses of herons and loons.</p><h2 id=everglades-national-park-florida>Everglades National Park, Florida</h2><p>Renowned for its vast wetlands and subtropical climate, Everglades National Park is a birdwatcher&rsquo;s paradise. The diversity of habitats—spanning marshes, mangroves, and sawgrass prairies—is home to over 350 bird species. This unique ecosystem offers opportunities to observe wading birds like great blue herons, roseate spoonbills, and snowy egrets in their natural splendor.</p><p>During winter months, migratory species such as hawks, kestrels, and warblers can be observed in abundance. The Anhinga Trail and Eco Pond are among the top birdwatching locations within the park. Additionally, the sight of ancient wood storks or a congregation of colorful ibises is sure to leave any birder overjoyed.</p><h2 id=yellowstone-national-park-wyoming-montana-and-idaho>Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho</h2><p>Better known for its geothermal features and megafauna, Yellowstone National Park is also an excellent site for birdwatching. Its diverse habitats, ranging from sagebrush plains to alpine meadows, make it possible to observe over 300 species of birds.</p><p>One of Yellowstone’s signature avian residents is the trumpeter swan, a majestic and sensitive species often found along the tranquil waters of the Yellowstone and Firehole Rivers. Birders can also look forward to spotting bald eagles, ospreys, and sandhill cranes during their visit. Lamar Valley and Hayden Valley are outstanding areas for birdwatching, offering both scenic views and an abundance of species.</p><h2 id=great-smoky-mountains-national-park-tennessee-and-north-carolina>Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina</h2><p>The lush forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park are home to an extraordinary range of bird species, making it one of the most biodiverse parks in the country. Particularly rich in warblers—often referred to as the &ldquo;warbler capital of the world&rdquo;—the Smokies are an essential destination for birdwatchers.</p><p>Spring and summer bring waves of vibrant songbirds, with golden-winged warblers, blue-headed vireos, and scarlet tanagers commonly appearing. For a more challenging birding experience, venture up to the park&rsquo;s higher elevations, where you may find species like the red-breasted nuthatch and purple finch. Popular birding trails include Clingmans Dome Road and Cades Cove.</p><h2 id=big-bend-national-park-texas>Big Bend National Park, Texas</h2><p>With its blend of desert, mountains, and riverine environments, Big Bend National Park is a unique hotspot for birding, especially for those seeking species typically found in the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. The park’s remote location and untouched wilderness create ideal conditions for observing over 450 bird species, both locally rare and widely distributed.</p><p>The Colima warbler—a species found nowhere else in the United States—attracts birdwatchers to the Chisos Mountains in the spring. Other notable sightings include vermilion flycatchers, painted buntings, and Montezuma quail. The Rio Grande Village and Cottonwood Campground areas are must-visit spots within the park for bird enthusiasts.</p><h2 id=olympic-national-park-washington>Olympic National Park, Washington</h2><p>Olympic National Park offers a variety of habitats, from rocky shorelines to rainforests, supporting a dynamic avian population. Coastal areas are home to shorebirds and seabirds, such as black oystercatchers, marbled murrelets, and harlequin ducks, while the park’s old-growth forests echo with the sounds of warblers and woodpeckers.</p><p>During migration, the coastal route of the park becomes particularly lively. High-altitude areas, such as Hurricane Ridge, provide a chance to see species like gray-crowned rosy-finches and white-tailed ptarmigans. Birdwatching experiences in Olympic often feel more intimate due to the park&rsquo;s relative isolation, and its ever-changing habitats promise a different experience every time you visit.</p><h2 id=glacier-national-park-montana>Glacier National Park, Montana</h2><p>Glacier National Park&rsquo;s immense wilderness provides a prime stage for birdwatching. With its hundreds of miles of trails and a mix of alpine meadows, forests, and lakes, the park offers birders opportunity after opportunity to spot avian residents and visitors.</p><p>Migratory waterfowl, including mallards, goldeneyes, and Canada geese, can often be found on the park’s many lakes and rivers. Meanwhile, high-elevation areas may host golden eagles, Clark’s nutcrackers, and mountain bluebirds. The serene beauty of places like Swiftcurrent Lake and Logan Pass makes them ideal locations to combine awe-inspiring scenery with exciting birdwatching opportunities.</p><h2 id=dry-tortugas-national-park-florida>Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida</h2><p>Located 70 miles west of Key West, Dry Tortugas National Park is one of the most unique birdwatching destinations in the U.S. This remote cluster of islands is a significant stopover for migratory birds journeying between South and North America, while also providing nesting habitats for several seabird species.</p><p>The park is particularly famous for its large colonies of sooty terns and magnificent frigatebirds. Birdwatchers visiting during spring migration often encounter hundreds of songbirds, including warblers, orioles, and buntings.
