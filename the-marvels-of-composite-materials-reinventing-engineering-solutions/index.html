One such category of materials that has been making waves in the engineering world is composite materials. These materials, made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different physical or chemical properties, have opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for engineers and designers across various industries.
Composite materials are engineered materials with superior properties that are a result of the combination of two or more individual materials. The combination can be made at the macroscopic, microscopic, or even atomic level, resulting in a material that exhibits properties that are significantly different from those of its individual constituents.</p><h2 id=reinventing-engineering-solutions>Reinventing Engineering Solutions</h2><p>The versatility of composite materials has made them a go-to solution for a wide range of engineering challenges.
